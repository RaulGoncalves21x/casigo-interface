# CasiGO - Casino on the GO üé∞

**Project Name:** CasiGO - Casino on the GO  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Discipline:** Interface Development | Universidade da Maia - Computer Science 
**Year:** 2021  

## Project Overview

CasiGO is a front-end web interface project developed as part of the "Interface Development" course during my college studies in 2021. The primary objective of this project was to assess our ability to create graphic interfaces for web applications, without a functional backend. All elements and interactions are hardcoded to focus on the design and user experience aspects.

The chosen theme for this project was a casino interface, offering a clean and engaging design. The project simulates a casino platform where users can interact with various elements, such as games, user profile, and navigation, but no real functionality or server-side interaction is implemented. No mobile support was implemented, and the interface is primarily designed for desktop usage.

**Note**: This project, originally developed in 2021, has been bulk uploaded to GitHub in 2024 as part of archiving my old college projects. The project is in its final state as it was when completed, and no further updates or functional backend integration are planned. It serves as a demonstration of my early front-end development work.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

- **HTML**: Structuring the webpage content using semantic and accessible HTML.
- **CSS**: Designing and styling the interface to create a visually appealing and responsive casino interface.
- **JavaScript**: Adding dynamic behavior and interaction to the interface, such as toggling menus, animations, and user feedback.

This project provided a hands-on opportunity to apply the fundamental skills of front-end development while designing an interactive and visually cohesive interface.

## Key Features

- **Home Page (`home/`):** A welcome screen that introduces users to the CasiGO platform, highlighting different games and offers.
- **Games Page (`games/`):** A collection of casino games, with placeholders and visual representations of the games available (e.g., slots, poker).
- **Login/Signup Page (`login_signup/`):** A hardcoded login and signup form for user authentication (non-functional, just a UI).
- **Account Movements Page (`account_movements/`):** A mockup page where users can view their account transactions (e.g., winnings, losses) in a hardcoded format.
- **Premium Account Details Page (`premium_account_details/`):** A page that displays information for premium account holders (e.g., perks, balance).
- **User Profile Page (`profile/`):** A static page displaying mock user profile details such as name, account balance, and status.
- **Store Page (`store/`):** A static interface where users can explore merchandising items available for purchase within the casino platform (e.g., T-Shirts, Hoodies).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the project, including pages for the home, game screens, and user profile.
- **CSS**: Responsible for all the styling and layout of the project, with a focus on responsive design. Flexbox and media queries were utilized to adapt the interface to different devices.
- **JavaScript**: Added dynamic behavior and user interaction on the client side. JS was used for animations, form validation (where applicable), and basic interactivity, such as game selection and menu toggling.
